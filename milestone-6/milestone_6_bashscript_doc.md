## 🔹 Hands-On Practice
- Wrote a **basic script** to display uptime, memory, and disk usage.  
- Automated **Apache web deployment** using bash.  
- Used **variables** for reusability and flexibility.  
- Practiced passing **arguments** into scripts.  
- Explored **system variables** for automation.  
- Implemented **if-else** conditions and **for loops**.  
- Wrote a **monitoring script** to check and restart Apache automatically.
