# MILESTONE-1: DevOps + Cloud Learning Journey

## Topics Covered:

### What is DevOps?
- Overview of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- Phases: Requirement â†’ Planning â†’ Design â†’ Development â†’ Testing â†’ Deployment â†’ Maintenance
- SDLC Models: Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, Big Bang
- Agile vs Waterfall comparison

### DevOps Lifecycle
- Code â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Deploy â†’ Release â†’ Monitor â†’ Feedback
- Introduced Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Tools discussed: GitHub, Jenkins, Artifact repository

### DevOps Automation Tools
- System Automation: Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- Cloud Infra Automation: Terraform, CloudFormation
- CI/CD: Jenkins, Octopus Deploy

### Virtualization & VM Concepts
**Before Virtualization:**
- 1 service per physical server  
- Costly and underutilized infrastructure  

**After Virtualization:**
- Use of Virtual Machines (VMs)  
- Host OS, Guest OS, Hypervisor types (Bare-metal vs Hosted)  
- VMware, Oracle VirtualBox, and snapshot concepts  

### VM Setup (Manual + Automated)
**Manual VM Setup:**
- Installed CentOS and Ubuntu using VirtualBox  
- Enabled virtualization in BIOS  
- Disabled Hyper-V and WSL for smooth VM operation  

**Automated Setup Using Vagrant:**
- Used Vagrant to automate VM creation  
- Practiced commands:  
  - `vagrant init`  
  - `vagrant up`  
  - `vagrant ssh`  
  - `vagrant halt`  
  - `vagrant destroy`  

## Key Takeaways:
- Understood software development models and why DevOps is important  
- Practiced VM provisioning manually and automatically using Vagrant  
- Gained clarity on infrastructure automation and virtualization  

## Next Week's Plan:
- Learn Linux basics  
- Explore Git and GitHub for version control
