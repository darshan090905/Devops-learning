# DevOps + Cloud Learning : Milestone - 2

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🐧 Linux Fundamentals
**History**
- 1984 – GNU Project & GPL License  
- 1991 – Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds  
- Today – Linux kernel + GNU utilities = complete open-source OS  

**Core Principles**
- Everything is a file  
- Small single-purpose programs  
- Text-based configuration  
- Strong community & security  

**Popular Distributions**
- Desktop: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian  
- Server: RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu Server  

**Directory Structure**
- `/home` – user directories  
- `/bin`, `/sbin` – executables  
- `/etc` – configuration files  
- `/var` – logs, server data  
- `/boot` – kernel & bootloader

### ⚙️ Linux Command Practice
- Navigation: `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`  
- Copy/Move/Delete: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`  
- File editing with `vim`  
- File types: regular, directory, links, special files  
- Linking: `ln -s`  
- Viewing system info: `uptime`, `free -m`  

---

### 🔍 Searching & Filtering
- `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, `find`, `locate`  
- `more`, `less`, `head`, `tail -f`  

---

### 👥 User & Group Management
- Creating, modifying, and deleting users & groups  
- Assigning permissions & ownership  

---

### 🔐 File Permissions
- Symbolic & numeric `chmod` methods  
- `chown` for ownership  
- Using `sudo` & `visudo` for privilege management  

---

### 📦 Package Management
- RPM-based: `rpm`, `yum`, `dnf`  
- Debian-based: `dpkg`, `apt`  
- Adding/removing packages and managing repositories  

---

### 🔄 Service & Process Management
- `systemctl` for service control  
- `top`, `ps -ef`, `kill` for process management  

---

### 📦 Archiving & Compression
- `tar` for compress/extract  
- `zip`, `unzip`  

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Mastered essential Linux skills for DevOps
